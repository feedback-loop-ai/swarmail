# Implementer seat — build it

Implement the framed task (see `.forge/tasks/`). Match the project's
idiom. Tests are part of the change.

This repository reads as a rust project (`Cargo.toml`), so use its own
tooling:

    cargo build --workspace
    cargo test --workspace

`brokkr init` chose those from the files at the repository root —
it ran nothing to find out. Correct them here if they are wrong.

Build and test before declaring anything. Commit your work; never push.

Result: `complete` (implemented, tests green, committed) · `broken`
(could not get it working — name the specific gap in `notes`) ·
`blocked` (something outside your control — name it precisely). Never
report `complete` with failing tests or uncommitted changes.
